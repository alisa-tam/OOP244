Reflection - Workshop 9

1. If you put your templated functions in the implementation files, then the program
   will not compile since the function will not know which type to apply.
2. Yes, it does work, but the template function needs to be defined before main().
3. You could have done a bunch of overloaded functions for this project, but you would
   be duplicating code. The advantage of using templates is that you can use the same
   function for variable if multiple types, which cuts down on code duplication (and
   the amount of work you need to do)
4. Yes, the two templates are equivalent.
