1. A namespace is a scope area that can enclose different entities. This is done so when
programmers develop different parts of an application, the scoping rules make sure there
is no conflict between similiarly named variables.

2. Header files are needed for because they contain class definitions and function prototypes.
They are also #include(d) in implementation files, since we cannot include an implementation
file in another implementation file.

3. You should never compile header files, because they are preproccessed since they are #include(d)
in the implementation file.  

4. You should never include a .cpp file in another .cpp file because then the modules would
be highly coupled, and it would give away too much detail about the application.

5. In this workshop, I learned how to use namespaces, and how to use the scope resolution 
operator in my other files. It also reinforced how to created and reference header files
in my implementation files. It also got my into the C++ mindset, since i'm still stuck in C!
