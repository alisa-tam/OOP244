Reflection


1)	A safe empty state is when instance variables in an object are initialized,
	meaning they are in a well-definded state from the time of their creation.
	Another safe empty state is when variables are initialied to a null pointer.
	
2)	You can minimize code duplication be re-using functions in code. Like in this
	exercise, using the display() function.
	
3)	The canTravelWith() member function can access the private data of the object
	referenced in its parameter because public member functions can be used to 
	access the private members

4)	To ensure that the strncpy() function executes correctly, it needs 2 arrays and
	the number of charactes to copy.

5)	I learned a lot about constructors and how to use them in code.
