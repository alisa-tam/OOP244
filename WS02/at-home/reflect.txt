1) We need to create a new dynamic memory since we need to increase the size of the memory. The previous alloted memory had
limited size, and since we needed a larger size, we allocated new dynamic memory. 

2) We do not need to use the delete operator to deallocate the memory occupied by the name since we only do this for dynamic
memory. The name has an alloted size, and therefore does not need dynamic allocation/deallocation.

3) The complier knows when definiti9on to call based on the parameters being passed. When there are overloaded functions,
the complier determines the most appropriate definition to use by comparing the argument types.

4) In the workshop, I learned about overloading functions and how they are applied to code. I also learned how to allocate
and deallocate dynamic memory.
