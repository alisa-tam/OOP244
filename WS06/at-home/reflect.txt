Workshop 6 Reflection

1. The copy assignment operator checks for self-assignment before anything else because
   if the instance is already self assigned, it can cause the program to behave in an
   unpredictable way. 

2. I avoided duplication code by creating an additional member function that breaks down
   the numbers to validate them. This meant that I did not have to repeat this code in
   other member functions

3. In this lab, I learned how to validate a phone number (which was tricky to figure out).
